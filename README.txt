1) From a terminal window launch the server using server.py

2) From another terminal window launch any number of clients using client.py 

3) At launch of the client the user is prompted for a port number that will be used for peer to peer connections.

4) The user is then prompted to enter the path to the RFC folder. Enter either "/RFC1/", "/RFC2/", or "/RFC3/" using the structure provided, or make your own. (If making your own, the RFC files must be txt files and named in the format of "NUMBER - TITLE.txt")

5) The user can then make selections from there for getting RFCs, looking up RFCs, listing the available RFCs, exiting, or shutting down the server.
